8. The three blocks are everything inside the if statement and the lines print('bacon') and print('ham').

    print('bacon')
else:
    print('ham')
print('spam')

    The continue statement skips the current iteration of the loop.

12. They all do the same thing. The loops starts from 0 and keeps incrementing and executing until it reaches 9.

13. using for loop:
 
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)


using while loop:

i = 1
while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1

14. spam.bacon()
